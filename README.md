Please add your code in the uncertainty_GM function in UncerrtaintyM.py

To run (for testing and debugging), use the Uncertainty.py
Set the dataset name(data_name), uncertainty measure of choice(unc_method), and the parameters of the learning model(prams). 
Currently, the only learning algorithm supported is random forest.
For systematic experiments, it is best first to insert the task into the database and then run Uncertainty.py using the bash script run_unc.sh
